                <h4>Adversity is a blessing in disguise!</h4>
                <p>Regardless if you are a newbie who is beginning to program your first web app, or a seasoned developer working a complex project, just remember: adversity is your friend!</p>

                <p>Take a breath, take a break, then remind yourself that no challenge is too big, and anything you set your mind to achieve is possible. Overcoming adversity will bring more confidence to your mindset, and pride in your work ethic.</p>

                <h4>Pushing beyond our comfort zone is a critical step in our personal growth &amp; development</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
